### Iteration 1

Use TDD to create a Joke class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/joke'
# => true

pry(main)> joke = Joke.new(1, "Why did the strawberry cross the road?", "Because his mother was in a jam.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007f84602e4190...>

pry(main)> joke.id
# => 1

pry(main)> joke.setup
# => "Why did the strawberry cross the road?"

pry(main)> joke.punchline
# => "Because his mother was in a jam."
```

### Iteration 2

Use TDD to create a User class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/joke'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/user'
# => true

pry(main)> sal = User.new("Sal")
# => #<User:0x00007fb71e1eb8d8...>

pry(main)> sal.name
# => "Sal"

pry(main)> sal.jokes
# => []

pry(main)> joke_1 = Joke.new(1, "Why did the strawberry cross the road?", "Because his mother was in a jam.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007fb71da169f0...>

pry(main)> joke_2 = Joke.new(2, "How do you keep a lion from charging?", "Take away its credit cards.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007fb71d8e0bd0...>

pry(main)> sal.learn(joke_1)

pry(main)> sal.learn(joke_2)

pry(main)> sal.jokes
# => [#<Joke:0x00007fb71da169f0...>, #<Joke:0x00007fb71d8e0bd0...>]
```

### Iteration 3

Use TDD to update your User class so that it responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/joke'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/user'
# => true

pry(main)> sal = User.new("Sal")
# => #<User:0x00007fb71e1eb8d8...>

pry(main)> ali = User.new("Ali")
# => #<User:0x00007fb71e1a4348...>

pry(main)> joke_1 = Joke.new(1, "Why did the strawberry cross the road?", "Because his mother was in a jam.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007fb71da169f0...>

pry(main)> joke_2 = Joke.new(2, "How do you keep a lion from charging?", "Take away its credit cards.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007fb71d8e0bd0...>

pry(main)> sal.tell(ali, joke_1)

pry(main)> sal.tell(ali, joke_2)

pry(main)> ali.jokes
# => [#<Joke:0x00007fb71da169f0...>, #<Joke:0x00007fb71d8e0bd0...>]

pry(main)> ali.joke_by_id(1)
# => #<Joke:0x00007fb71da169f0...>

pry(main)> ali.joke_by_id(2)
# => #<Joke:0x00007fb71d8e0bd0...>
```

### Iteration 4

Use TDD to create an OpenMic class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/open_mic'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/user'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/joke'
# => true

pry(main)> open_mic = OpenMic.new({location: "Comedy Works", date: "11-20-18"})    
# => #<OpenMic:0x00007fe8fd9f5e00...>

pry(main)> open_mic.location
# => "Comedy Works"

pry(main)> open_mic.date
# => "11-20-18"

pry(main)> open_mic.performers
# => []

pry(main)> sal = User.new("Sal")
# => #<User:0x00007fe8fda12a00...>

pry(main)> ali = User.new("Ali")
# => #<User:0x00007fe8ff0dddc0...>

pry(main)> open_mic.welcome(sal)

pry(main)> open_mic.welcome(ali)

pry(main)> open_mic.performers
# => [#<User:0x00007fe8fda12a00...>, #<User:0x00007fe8ff0dddc0...>]

pry(main)> joke_1 = Joke.new(1, "Why did the strawberry cross the road?", "Because his mother was in a jam.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007fe8fd892978...>

pry(main)> joke_2 = Joke.new(2, "How do you keep a lion from charging?", "Take away its credit cards.")    
# => #<Joke:0x00007fe8fe19f250...>

pry(main)> ali.learn(joke_1)  

pry(main)> ali.learn(joke_2)  

pry(main)> open_mic.repeated_jokes?
# => false

pry(main)> ali.tell(sal, joke_1)    

pry(main)> open_mic.repeated_jokes?
# => true
```
